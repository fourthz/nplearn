The purpose of this vignette is to illustrate the typical steps and assumptions 
used by researchers when analyzing data.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)

data_file <- system.file("extdata", "IQ_Study_Data.csv", package = "nplearn")
```

This example uses the readr package that is part of the tidyverse, so this 
package must be installed prior to running this script.

```{r setup}
library(nplearn)
library(readr)
```

First, data are imported into the statistical software.

```{r}
iq_data <- read_csv(data_file)
```
